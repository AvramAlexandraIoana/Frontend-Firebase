Design Patterns Description:

1.Decorator (HOC - Higher Order Component):
File: RegisterWithLayout.tsx
Description: The withLayout HOC is used to wrap components with a common layout structure provided by the Layout component.

2.Builder Pattern:
File: FormBuilder.tsx
Description: The FormBuilder class helps construct a complex form step by step. It abstracts the construction process of the form fields and allows easy extension.

3.Factory Pattern:
File: ComponentFactory.tsx
Description: The ComponentFactory module provides factory functions (createMuiLink and createButton) for creating MUI Link and Button components, promoting consistent component creation.

4.Adapter Pattern:
File: Adapter.tsx
Description: The adaptToLayout function acts as an adapter, allowing different components to conform to a common layout structure.

5.Facade Pattern:
File: RegisterFormFacade.tsx
Description: The RegisterFormFacade component encapsulates the complex structure of the registration form. It provides a simplified interface to interact with the form while internally managing the details.
