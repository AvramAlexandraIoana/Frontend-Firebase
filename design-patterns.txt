1.Higher Order Component (HOC) - Decorator Pattern:
File: withLayout.tsx
Description: This HOC wraps a component with the common layout structure provided by the Layout component. It enhances the component with additional features, in this case, a consistent layout.

2.Adapter Pattern:
File: Adapter.tsx (renamed to adaptToLayout for clarity)
Description: The adaptToLayout function acts as an adapter, allowing different components to conform to a common layout structure. It encapsulates the details of adapting the layout and provides a consistent interface.

3.Factory Pattern:
File: ComponentFactory.tsx
Description: The ComponentFactory module provides factory functions (createMuiLink and createButton) for creating MUI Link and Button components. This promotes consistent and centralized component creation.

4.Builder Pattern:
File: FormBuilder.tsx
Description: The FormBuilder class helps construct a complex form step by step. It abstracts the construction process of form fields and allows easy extension. It follows the builder pattern by providing a fluent interface for building forms.

5.Facade Pattern:
File: RegisterFormFacade.tsx
Description: The RegisterFormFacade component encapsulates the complex structure of the registration form. It provides a simplified interface to interact with the form while internally managing the details. This promotes a clear separation of concerns and simplifies the usage of the form.
